# Capstone Project

the-joker is a serverless cloud app. It offers a new approach to Virtual mentorship for teens, adults, depression people and in generall for those who just needs funny jokes to flourish their day after a long hours work.

I intend to implement virtual customer support reps (chatbots)in the future. My service would adhere to the principle of maximum compliance and full transparency in knowing user problems and finding the best joke and cancelling solutions. I strive to establish long-term relationships with users.
